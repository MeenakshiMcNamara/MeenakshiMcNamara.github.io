<p>
Hey y'all! I'm Meenakshi McNamara (they/them), a first-year math grad student at <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/meenakshi-mcnamara">Princeton</a>. 
</p>
<br> 

<p>
Currently I'm still exploring what kinds of math I'll focus on for my PhD, but I have interests in algebraic geometry, topology, operator algebras, number theory, and mathematical physics (and probably more!). I'm really excited to have the chance to explore all of this though! 
</p>

<p>
	Besides math (and physics) related things, I love to read (pretty much anything, but especially scifi/ fantasy on my own), write and draw when I have time, and play games. I also like rock climbing and have recently tried a bit of swing, but I currently have a foot injury. Also also: I joined SPEAR (students for prison education, abolution, and reform), and definitely recommend getting involved if you're interested!
</p>

<p> Oh yeah, probably I should give a bit of background on me... my first professional goal was to become a paleontologist (from ages 3 through 13 ish), and I still really love dinosaurs (and learning about evolution in general. For example, whale evolution is pretty cool, and I also like general flora and fauna from the Mesozoic era including mammals, pterosaurs, and various marine reptiles). I entered college at Purdue with the plan to study physics, but added a math major to help out with theory. And then I was slowly pulled over to math. I really have a lot of important mentors to thank for supporting me and encouraging me to follow my passions, and in particular I want to call out to Rolando de Santiago who has had an immeasurable impact on me (both career and life)! SO. Now I'm in math at Princeton, but I still am passionate about physics. In fact, I did a master's in theoretical physics at the Perimeter Institute last year, which was an amazing experience (althoug I managed to turn my essay topic into almost being pure math lol). So anyways, I guess that's my "educational" background since starting college :)
</p>
<!-- 
I am particularly interested in representations of \(p\)-adic groups and geometric representation theory.
In my free time, I enjoy running and drinking tea. <br>

I'm also currently co-organizing the <a href="fy-seminar.html">first-year seminar</a>. Go to the linked site to see more details!

Also, I'm organizing a learning seminar on <a href="noncommutativegeometrysem.html"> noncommutative geometry</a>, and you can similarly find details on the linked site! There's also a whatsapp group, so message me to be added :).
</p>

<p> You can learn more about me in the other tabs (I'm only building the site rn tho, so some parts are probably a bit broken.). Also, thanks Kenta for letting me copy your website stuff!</p>
